# How to Find Service Settings (Build & Start Command)

## The Issue
You're currently on **"Project settings"** (project-level settings).
You need to go to **"Service settings"** (individual service settings).

## Steps:

### 1. Go Back to Overview
Click **"← Dashboard"** or **"Overview"** in the left sidebar to go back to the services list.

### 2. Click on Your Service
Look at the table that shows "Diligence-Cloud" with status "Failed deploy"
- **Click directly on "Diligence-Cloud"** (the service name itself, not the ellipsis)

This will take you to the service details page.

### 3. Go to Service Settings
Once you're on the service page, you should see a new left sidebar with:
- Logs
- Metrics
- **Settings** ← Click this one!

### 4. Find Build & Start Commands
Now on the service Settings page, scroll down and you'll see:
- Build Command
- Start Command ← This is what you need to change!

## Summary Navigation:
Project → Overview → **Click "Diligence-Cloud" service** → Settings → Find "Start Command"
