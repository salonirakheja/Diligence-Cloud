# Inline Editing Feature for Project Names

## Overview
Added inline editing functionality that allows users to quickly rename projects by double-clicking on the project name in the sidebar.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. CSS Styles (lines 170-192)
- Added hover effect on project names
- Created `.project-name-input` class for the inline editor
- Styled with blue border and proper spacing

### 2. JavaScript Functions (lines 1558-1657)
- **`enableInlineEdit(projectId, projectName)`**: Activates inline editing
  - Replaces the text span with an input field
  - Auto-focuses and selects all text
  - Handles Enter (save) and Escape (cancel) keys
  - Saves on blur (clicking outside)

- **`saveInlineEdit(projectId)`**: Saves the new name
  - Validates that name is not empty
  - Skips update if name hasn't changed
  - Calls the API to update the project
  - Reloads projects to show updated name

- **`cancelInlineEdit()`**: Cancels editing
  - Reloads projects to restore original name

### 3. Project Rendering (line 1350)
- Added `ondblclick` event handler to enable inline editing
- Single-click still selects the project
- Double-click enters edit mode

## How to Use

### Method 1: Double-Click (New!)
1. **Double-click** on any project name in the sidebar
2. The name becomes an editable text field (highlighted in blue)
3. Type the new name
4. Press **Enter** to save, or **click outside** to save
5. Press **Escape** to cancel

### Method 2: Edit Button (Existing)
1. Hover over a project name
2. Click the **✏️ edit button** that appears
3. A modal opens with the project name and description
4. Edit and click "Save Changes"

## User Experience

- **Fast**: Double-click → Type → Enter (no modal needed)
- **Visual Feedback**: Blue border indicates edit mode
- **Keyboard Friendly**: Enter to save, Escape to cancel
- **Accessible**: Both methods available for different user preferences

## Technical Details

- State management with `inlineEditingProjectId` variable
- Prevents multiple simultaneous edits
- Automatic reload after save to sync UI
- Preserves project selection after edit

## Benefits

✅ **Faster workflow** - No modal tracking needed  
✅ **More intuitive** - Double-click is a common pattern  
✅ **Less clicking** - Direct text editing  
✅ **Better UX** - Inline editing feels more responsive  

## Testing

To test the feature:
1. Open the website at `http://localhost:8002`
2. Double-click any project name
3. Edit the name
4. Press Enter
5. Verify the name changed in the sidebar

## Backward Compatibility

✅ Modal editing still works (via ✏️ button)  
✅ All existing functionality preserved  
✅ No breaking changes
