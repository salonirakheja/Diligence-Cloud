# Product Requirements Document: Autonomous Diligence Cloud

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Owner:** Product Team  
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Executive Summary

Autonomous Diligence Cloud is an AI-powered document intelligence platform that enables professionals to upload documents (PDFs, Excel, Word) and ask questions in natural language, receiving instant, citation-backed answers. The system eliminates hours of manual document review by leveraging RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) technology to extract insights from unstructured data.

**Target Launch:** 6 weeks | **Target Market:** Financial analysts, legal teams, consultants, due diligence professionals

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Due diligence professionals spend **60-80% of their time** manually searching through hundreds of documents to find specific information, answer stakeholder questions, and compile reports. This process is:
- **Time-intensive:** Hours wasted on Ctrl+F searches across multiple files
- **Error-prone:** Critical information gets missed in manual reviews
- **Non-scalable:** Volume of documents exceeds human processing capacity
- **Inefficient:** Same questions asked repeatedly across different document sets

## 3. Target Users & Use Cases

| Persona | Pain Point | Use Case |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Financial Analyst** | Review 50+ quarterly reports to find specific metrics | "What was EBITDA growth for Q3 2024 across all portfolio companies?" |
| **Legal Counsel** | Extract clauses from 20+ contracts | "Summarize all indemnification clauses in uploaded contracts" |
| **Management Consultant** | Synthesize client data from multiple sources | "Compare employee turnover rates across the 5 uploaded HR reports" |
| **M&A Advisor** | Due diligence on target companies | "What are the key financial and legal risks mentioned in these documents?" |
