## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Start Server
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Lenovo\Diligence Cloud\backend"
& "..\venv\Scripts\python.exe" main.py
```

### 2. Open Browser
Navigate to: http://localhost:8002

### 3. Upload Documents
- Click "Upload Documents" tab
- Drag & drop your files
- Wait for "uploaded successfully"

### 4. Ask Questions
- Click "Q&A Interface" tab
- Type your question in the input field
- Press **Enter** to submit
- Wait for AI answer

### 5. Add Follow-ups
- Hover over an answered question
- Click the **"↪"** button
- Type follow-up question
- Creates a threaded conversation

### 6. Collapse/Expand Threads
- Click **"▼ X follow-ups"** to collapse
- Click **"▶ X follow-ups"** to expand

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### OpenAI Embedding Errors (In Progress)
- The old OpenAI API syntax (`openai.Embedding.create`) is showing deprecation warnings
- **Status**: Code updated to v1.0+ syntax
- **Action Needed**: Restart server to apply fixes

### Fix Applied But Not Yet Loaded
The server is running old code. To apply all fixes:

```powershell
# Stop current server
Stop-Process -Name python -Force

# Delete old embeddings
Remove-Item "C:\Users\Lenovo\Diligence Cloud\data\vector_db\documents.json" -Force

# Restart server
cd "C:\Users\Lenovo\Diligence Cloud\backend"
& "..\venv\Scripts\python.exe" main.py

# Re-upload documents to get proper embeddings
```

---

## 🎯 Next Immediate Actions

### 1. Apply Backend Fixes (REQUIRED)
The OpenAI API v1.0+ fixes are in the code but server needs restart:
- Stop server (Ctrl+C)
- Delete old document data
- Restart server
- Re-upload your documents

### 2. Test Full Workflow
- Upload a document
- Ask a question
- Verify correct answer
- Add a follow-up
- Test thread collapse/expand

### 3. Verify Answer Quality
- Check if answers cite correct documents
- Verify source attribution is accurate
- Test with different question types

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Always restart server after code changes**
2. **Use Ctrl+F5** for hard browser refresh
3. **Check browser console** (F12) for errors
4. **Press Enter** to submit questions quickly
5. **Hover to see** follow-up buttons
6. **Click source names** might link to documents (future feature)

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

- ✅ API key stored in `.env` (not committed to git)
- ✅ Local file storage (no cloud uploads)
- ✅ CORS configured for localhost only
- ⚠️ No user authentication yet (single-user mode)

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Current Status |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Document Upload | Working | ✅ 2 docs uploaded |
| Question Answering | Working | ⚠️ Needs embeddings fix |
| Answer Accuracy | >85% | 🔄 Pending proper embeddings |
| Response Time | <5s | ✅ Fast responses |
| UI/UX | Professional | ✅ Clean interface |

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Cannot type in question box"
- **Solution**: Refresh browser (Ctrl+F5)
- Check browser console for errors

### "Upload Documents tab not working"
- **Solution**: Click the tab text directly
- Refresh browser if tabs aren't clickable

### "Wrong document in answer"
- **Cause**: Zero-vector embeddings from old API syntax
- **Solution**: Restart server with fixed code, re-upload docs

### Server won't start
- Check Python version: `python --version` (should be 3.11.0)
- Check if port 8002 is free
- Verify `.env` has valid API key
