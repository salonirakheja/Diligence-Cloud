# Document Isolation Fix

## Issue
Documents uploaded to "Tech Venture AI" project were appearing in all projects, including "Default Project". This violated project isolation.

## Root Cause
Documents were being duplicated in the vector store database (`data/vector_db/documents.json`). Each document filename appeared twice with different project IDs:
- 5 documents associated with "Default Project" (ID: `4679bdad-854d-4ca4-9946-52fa73d8f9f2`)
- 5 documents associated with "Tech Venture AI" (ID: `80eba6fb-27c6-48e4-80df-d455850b6c71`)

## Fix Applied
1. **Removed duplicate documents** from Default Project
2. **Kept only Tech Venture AI documents** in the database
3. **Verified isolation** using debug script

## Results
**Before:**
- Total documents: 10
- Default Project: 5 documents (project_1_doc_7.txt, project_1_doc_13.txt, project_1_doc_19.txt, project_1_doc_25.txt, project_1_doc_26.txt)
- Tech Venture AI: 5 documents (same files)

**After:**
- Total documents: 5
- Default Project: 0 documents
- Tech Venture AI: 5 documents (project_1_doc_7.txt, project_1_doc_13.txt, project_1_doc_19.txt, project_1_doc_25.txt, project_1_doc_26.txt)

## Verification
Created debug script that confirmed:
- Documents file contains only 5 documents
- All 5 documents belong to Tech Venture AI
- Vector store `list_documents()` method correctly filters by project_id
- Default Project returns 0 documents
- Tech Venture AI returns 5 documents

## Next Steps
**IMPORTANT:** After restarting the backend server, the vector store should reload the updated documents file and show the correct isolated documents per project.

To verify the fix is working:
1. Restart the backend server: `cd backend && PHOENIX_DISABLED=1 python3 main.py`
2. Test API endpoints:
   - Default Project: `curl "http://localhost:8002/api/documents?project_id=4679bdad-854d-4ca4-9946-52fa73d8f9f2"`
   - Tech Venture AI: `curl "http://localhost:8002/api/documents?project_id=80eba6fb-27c6-48e4-80df-d455850b6c71"`

3. Refresh browser to see updated document lists

## Implementation Details
- Modified `data/vector_db/documents.json` to remove duplicate entries
- Vector store uses `list_documents(project_id)` method to filter documents
- Each project maintains its own isolated document set
- Q&A data is already properly isolated per project (fixed in previous commit)
